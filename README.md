# Espruino to Arduino to Hannio FlipDot Display
####a simple example to draw text with an Espruino and display to an Hannio FlipDot 5x7 module.<br>

I'm French and love accents on my letters. The Hannio lib use the Adafruit GFX lib for display chars.
There is no accents on it!
Espruino Pico is a little board with a beautifull lib to draw and use custom fonts on differents display.
Coding to board with js, is a really cool stuff for my webdesigner's knowledges.
I fall in love of this pretty little board (more ram, good libs, js than arduino)
After losing lot of time to control display with an Espruino. I've decided to use the Arduino's lib from Hannio to display text.

This a simple solution to draw with the espruino and control the display with the arduino.
