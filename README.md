# Espruino to Arduino to Hannio FlipDot Display
### a simple example to draw text with an Espruino and display to an Hannio FlipDot 5x7 module.<br>
<br>
I'm French and love accents on my letters. The Hannio lib use the Adafruit GFX lib for display chars.
There is no accents on it!<br>
Espruino Pico is a little board with a beautifull lib to draw and use custom fonts on differents display.<br>
Coding to board with js, is a really cool stuff for my webdesigner's knowledges.<br>
I fall in love of this pretty little board (more ram, good libs, js than arduino)<br>
After losing lot of time to control display with an Espruino. I've decided to use the Arduino's lib from Hannio to display text.<br>

This is a simple solution to draw with the espruino and control the display with the arduino.<br>

lib used for the flipdot display is from Hannio.org<br>
